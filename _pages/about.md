About Me
======
      I’m Teeranon Boonlitlakana, a forth-year Geoscience student at Mahidol University with a strong focus on gemology and laboratory research. I’ve built core skills in mineralogy, lithology, and lab techniques, and I’m keen to deepen them through hands-on work especially in settings like the Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand. My current interests align with my senior project on apatite in Kanchanaburi, and I’m known for being detail-oriented, analytical, and precise—qualities that support rigorous gemological research. Beyond coursework, I’ve contributed as an advisor at university open houses and supported national earth-science outreach, while gaining field exposure across Thailand (including Boh Ploy Lek Petch mine and PTTEP’s PSRC). I’m comfortable with ArcGIS, Adobe tools, and Microsoft Office, and I collaborate well in teams through clear communication, time management, and leadership.
