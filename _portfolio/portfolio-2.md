I completed the Python course on Kaggle, gaining a strong foundation in Python programming for data science and analytical workflows. The course focused on both conceptual understanding and hands-on practice through interactive exercises.

What I learned
+ Python syntax and variable assignment
+ Working with numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries
+ Writing and using functions effectively
+ Applying boolean logic and conditional statements
+ Using loops for repetitive tasks
+ Debugging code and using Python’s built-in documentation

Skills developed
+ Writing clean, readable, and well-structured Python code
+ Problem-solving using logical and programmatic thinking
+ Preparing for advanced topics such as Pandas, data analysis, and machine learning
