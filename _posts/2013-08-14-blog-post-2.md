This 2x2 grid of Harker diagrams compares Kanchanaburi (blue) and Chantaburi (red) samples by plotting key chemical "ingredients" (SiO₂, Al₂O₃, CaO, TiO₂) against the Mg# , a timeline of magma evolution. This reveals if the two locations share a common volcanic origin and reconstructs the magma's cooling history.
