In this project, I developed a Python application to extract and visualize weather forecast data from the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) API. The core challenge involved parsing a complex, polymorphic JSON structure where data formats varied dynamically between lists and dictionaries.

Key features include:

Automated Data Extraction: Connecting to the WeatherForecast7Days/v2 endpoint to retrieve weekly forecast data.

Advanced Data Cleaning: Implementing logic to handle inconsistent API responses (normalizing nested dictionaries vs. lists) and "zipping" column-oriented arrays into structured daily records.

Visualization:

A Line Chart tracking temperature trends over the next week for specific provinces (e.g., Bangkok).

A Choropleth Map of Thailand, merging forecast data with GeoJSON to color-code provinces based on maximum predicted temperatures.

This project demonstrates skills in API integration, robust error handling, and geospatial data visualization using Pandas and Geopandas.
